**Chemical-Compound-Classification**

*Binary Classification of Chemical Compounds on the basis of taste using Graph Neural Networks*

This is a machine learning solution for the classification of chemical compounds. We have extracted
and preprocessed data from a CSV file containing chemical information. Then trained a neural network to predict
whether a compound is bitter or sweet based on its atomic structure.

**Tools and Technologies: Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Model: Used the SchNet model in PyTorch for the implementation.**
